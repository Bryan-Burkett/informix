Examples for ruby REST.


ruby rails new ruby_rails_rest_HelloWorld

in gemfile gem 'rest-client'  if using rest-client, see note below
bundle install
rails g controller static_pages home info runTest

For windows system that I tested on, needed to change in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb 'application' in tags to 'default' in order to prevent errors when opening pages on server

All code for test placed in app/helpers/application_helper.rb

On windows machine, using local connection to informix database, rest-client failed due to SSL issues.  The package uses SSL by default

net::http worked well, so used it for testing.  Rest-client should work well on Bluemix
