Examples for ruby_DRDA.

This is a basic example of running simple database operations with ibm_db

These examples were ran in static page with little formatting.

rails new ruby_rails_drda_HelloWorld --database=ibm_db

Verify gem ibm_db in gemfile

For windows system that I tested on, needed to change in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb 'application' in tags to 'default' in order to prevent errors when opening pages on server

Note that require 'ibm_db'  is placed in app/controllers/application_controller.rb, not helper file

I did not modify database.yml since all connection info and calls to ibm_db were done with application_helper.rb
Documentation listed above gives examples of modifying database.yml file

Note that scaffolding with migrate:db did not work properly.  During the migration, a query was
sent to database server that had bad syntax.  I am unsure whether this is always an issue using ibm_db or 
possibly just with the current ruby/rails versions.  Due to this issue all access to database is
performed within application_helper.rb.

A good example of how to create and push your application to bluemix is given at
